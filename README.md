# YTLDR Front End
YTLDR is a website that summarizes and explains YouTube videos using the OpenAI Text-Da-Vinci-003 model.

## Usage
To use YTLDR, simply enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to summarize in the input box on the homepage. Click on the "Summarize" button to generate a summary of the video. The summary will be displayed on the screen along with the title and thumbnail of the video.

## Technologies Used
The YTLDR front end is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We used Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to send requests to the YTLDR back end. The back end of YTLDR uses the OpenAI Text-Da-Vinci-003 model to generate the video summaries.
